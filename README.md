# Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer

This repo contains my personal notes and exercises while reading the book
"Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer".

Mostly, the focus on doing the exercises and proving the theorem, but there are also
some notes scattered throughout, and some transcriptions, mainly to provide the needed
contexts for understanding the exercises.
